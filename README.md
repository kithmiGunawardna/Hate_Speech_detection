# 🚫 Hate Speech Detection System

## 🌟 Overview
Hate speech is a pervasive problem in online platforms, necessitating effective detection tools to foster healthier digital spaces. This project tackles hate speech detection using both **classical machine learning** and **deep learning** approaches, culminating in a robust system powered by **BiLSTM** for optimal accuracy.

We’ve also developed a lightweight **web application** that utilizes the trained BiLSTM model to identify hate speech in real-time.
